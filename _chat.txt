If the number is provided, go ahead and send an SMS. You can go further and call the given number. If you try 10 times, atleast you'll stand a chance of getting one or two views.
Below is a sample of making requests👇👇
[07/02/2023, 17:35:53] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Dear Joy,
I am .NAME... 28yrs of age, a Food Engineering master student at UCD, Belfield campus where I’m currently staying in the student accommodation till 18th May 2022 as per the contract. I am under ICOS (Ireland Fellows’) Scholarship managed by Department of Foreign Affairs, which will carter for my full accommodation fee. I am still working on my thesis during summer semester thus I’m currently looking for a single bedroom accommodation 24/7 from mid-May till End August, which I may consider for extension. Otherwise, I won’t mind getting one available from early May as a way of securing my future accommodation. I am flexible and dynamic, hardworking, non-smoker, clean, responsible, and respectful person with positive mind who is social and appreciate different cultures. My hobbies are watching videos, music, and cooking. I will appreciate getting this room, a place to call a home away home. Thank you.
Regards,
JAMES

[06/03/2023, 06:54:57] ~ Nekesa: For Amsterdam there is no transit visa requirement.  I have always flown KQ and never had issues unless of course one is stepping out of the airport.
[06/03/2023, 07:26:13] ~ Davine Fernando: Airlines are strict they might stop you from boarding if you dont have a transit visa … i think for heathrow you need one… try other options … it’s not worth the risk tbh😬
[06/03/2023, 07:36:55] ~ CPA Nick Kandie: What I is that, if you are connecting more than 2 European countries, you will need a transit visa
[06/03/2023, 08:01:55] ~ Nekesa: But if you are flying into Dublin, why would one need two European connections surely bc it doesn’t get cheaper does it?
[06/03/2023, 08:05:19] ~ CPA Nick Kandie: Sometimes you might get a flight having 2 connections, I don't really know the essence but at least they advise you to get a transit visa
[06/03/2023, 10:48:24] ~ Mary: Thanx so much for the advices
[06/03/2023, 12:25:24] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: The more the connections the cheaper is the ticket. Direct flights is always regarded the most expensive ones, coz the company must ensure that the factors of production is economical to the said flight company!

But naaah….let me take the shortest, most direct and if possible, minimum or no lay over time!!!

Visa is a must

[07/03/2023, 18:15:18] ~ Naomi.: One time I missed the Dublin flight.and had to catch one to Heathrow.Then to Dublin.I did not have a transit visa.But they made me sign a lot of documents stating that I will not stay in UK and was just transiting.
But it’s not worth taking the risk.maybe nliangukia tu watu wazuri.
I did not have an IRP
[07/03/2023, 18:15:37] ~ Doc: No just a valid residence permit...used it twice with no issues
[07/03/2023, 18:15:55] ~ Doc: With an IRP ur good
[07/03/2023, 18:16:25] ~ Doc: First timers don't dare with no transit visa, just use Amsterdam

[07/03/2023, 18:17:42] ~ Doc: That's why...

[07/03/2023, 19:48:28] ~ Doc: Lakini Emma,....why risk....juu it's ideally not allowed.... but again Kila mtu ako na experience yake...for me..i still maintain that don't dare as a first timer bila transit visa....coz you will be taking unnecessary risks & chances and stress ya additional documentation to convince them u won't stay in the UK...coz people say they are on transit only to end up in the UK illegally...🤔
[07/03/2023, 19:56:39] ~ Albert: Have a visa guys. Don’t go to the airport with your bags only to be told you won’t travel. Its not only embarrassing but very depressing. I have seen people cry at the  check in desks

[07/03/2023, 20:55:34] ~ Steve: Did the same and it was smooth. I think thing is one needs to be only connecting flights and only one ticket from departure to destination.
[08/03/2023, 06:58:49] ~ ouso: A quick one, does the Irish IRP dictate that one must spend a certain time in Ireland within a period, say a year?

[23/03/2023, 15:30:12] ~ ~monyi: Actually 6 months. 

You’ll have to do the driving test afresh. However, one can obtain an exemption on some practical classes as long you have a letter from NTSA to show that you had a driving license in Kenya. 

You will still have to sit the theory and about 6 classes as opposed to 12 if you go for this method.
[23/03/2023, 15:32:19] ~ Halima: Thanks. This is helpful. How do I get the NTSA letter?Do I have to be in Kenya to get it?

[28/03/2023, 18:12:32] ~ Lukas: It's called seasonal affective disorder, look into it.
[28/03/2023, 18:21:20] ~ Halima: Thanks for sharing. I looked into it. I don’t think that’s the issue because it subsides after a few days. Somebody mentioned it’s changes in circadian rhythm which makes more sense. Anyway hatukuambiwa hizi vitu before we travelled abroad
[28/03/2023, 18:24:09] ~ Halima: Thanks for everyone who reached out via DM.
[28/03/2023, 18:43:50] ~ David: Also, those are 85% vitamin D deficiency symptoms, be sure to take your Vitamin D tablets during winter. When there is no sun.
‎[28/03/2023, 19:27:33] ~ Samuel Kaburu: ‎image omitted

[28/03/2023, 20:27:30] ~ Stacy Mtawali: The first time i experienced the vit d deficiency symptoms i felt like i was dying no energy nothing when i was told its just the sun am lacking i couldnt believe it🤦🏽‍♀️
[28/03/2023, 20:53:09] ~ Halima: Eeh I didn’t know taking vitamins in Ireland is that important
[28/03/2023, 21:17:53] ~ ~monyi: This is the most plausible reason. Changes in your circadian rhythm.

Incase you may be interested further in the topic, amongst many other resources, there’s a podcast by a guy called Dr. Huberman. He does deep dives on such topics from a science & research perspective. 

This particular episode may be helpful -> https://overcast.fm/+2-B-yLfiI (available on all streaming platforms).
[28/03/2023, 21:29:15] ~ Essie: Also deworming . Do it often . Otherwise one day you won’t leave the bed due to fatigue. Especially combined with vitamin D deficiency. Shida tupu
[28/03/2023, 21:43:29] ~ Allan: Deworming is subjective. Some of the worms boost your immunity 😂.
[28/03/2023, 22:37:22] ~ Ck: Huku wanauza ABZ?🤔
[28/03/2023, 22:42:27] ~ Stacy Mtawali: 😆😆
[28/03/2023, 22:48:11] ~ Brunos Nyakundi: Yea but iko na jina tofauti hapa
[29/03/2023, 12:30:38] ~ Caroline: I agree with @353899755381... always take vitamin D tablets for at least 3 months. My vitamin D level once went down to zero and I was sick.. my mood even changed, hair loss etc 

I'll also recommend just go to GP every 6 months or so to do regular blood test ..  just to be sure your ok. Blood test results can show a lot of things 😅
[29/03/2023, 12:35:40] ~ Mel: Take advantage of any sunshine there is. If it's cold/windy but you have sunlight coming through your window then sunbathe indoors. The Sun is a powerful tool to improve mood & health

[30/03/2023, 17:02:15] ~ --: Folks, not sure of this has been asked before...but has anyone here transitioned from being a student (Stamp 2) into full time/permanent employment? 

Would you be so kind as to share the documentation/process & requirements + waiting periods.
[30/03/2023, 17:33:45] ~ Samuel Kaburu: After you finish ,they'll give you stamp 1G visa for 2 years (issued annually) .
Then you're eligible for full time work
[30/03/2023, 17:42:25] ~ mirokedi dickson: You can but you will need to go back to Kenya to get a new visa then they can revoke your student visa and you can continue in your college as a part time student.
[30/03/2023, 17:42:29] ~ mirokedi dickson: Hope that answers your question
[30/03/2023, 17:47:31] ~ mangetifaith: You don't need to go back to Kenya. I transitioned from stamp 2 to stamp1g while still here,got my GNIB card within two weeks and now working full time....60 hours in a week
[30/03/2023, 17:48:44] ~ mirokedi dickson: The question above is for a person who wants to transition without completion of school.
[30/03/2023, 17:51:14] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Not a must. 
You can complete your college then get stamp 1 if you happen to secure a job which grant you a work permit. Very possible. You have to either start with stamp 1 general permit or just 1 for critical skilled work visa which lasts for 2 years then u can be eligible to apply for stamp 4 a permanent residents. For general stamp 1, u have to work for about 4-5 yrs depending on the salary scale. The company can process ur permit very fast, as long as all documents are reading available, it can take about 1-2 weeks then everything is set!
[30/03/2023, 17:59:49] ~ mirokedi dickson: Have you completed your college seems guys are responding to usual process, of completing your college and transitioning to the usual stamp 1g if that is the case you just need your exit letter from college.

If you have children born here and want to process their documents ie birth certificates, IDs etc that's the place to be. Please remember to turn up with completed documents and all the necessary requirements.  If you're having issues accessing Ecitizen, let me know. Can I also emphasis something, embassy haiko hapa kuuza watu. Kama ulikuja na makaratasi zako haziko poa, Please please go and speak to them. They are here to advise and support people, dont suffer in silence please. You'll be surprised how many people have been supported and guided to put their papers in order. Kazi yetu kwa hii group nikusaidiana, its that simple.

Is there any way or possibility that one can change Student visa to skilled worker visa in Ireland?
[16/04/2023, 08:43:47] ~ Gentle Giant: You need to find a company that can do that for you. 

It rests solely on employer's/company's decision. That's what I know for sure. Maybe there could be another route. I stand to be informed.

The Network of Kenyan professionals in Ireland (NeKPI) would like to invite you to join our welfare group. Find more information about our welfare and the accompanying membership benefits on the attached webpage and how to join. You can also send us an email through info@kenyansinireland.ie if you have any questions or suggestions.

[08/05/2023, 17:38:35] ~ Marcel: This is good but I find this welfare is only for those planning wedding celebrations, baby hampers, sickness and funeral services. Could you guys come up with something like diaspora Sacco where Kenyans here can save and borrow money at any time they want so that wazee kama sisi we can buy or develop properties back home with the help of such Saccos? If our brothers here from west Africa especially Nigerians are having active financial Saccos why not us? My humble opinion though.

[08/05/2023, 18:32:13] ~ Marcel: This is great, well I don't know much about UCD but if it was UCC then they have some scholarships especially if you are in critical skills course they can give you upto 50% or even upto 100% based on merit.
[08/05/2023, 18:34:18] ~ Bee_Rugut ❤️: Aaah!that's amazing for UCD it's so hard to get.most of us who applied for scholarships got rejection emails💔
[08/05/2023, 18:39:59] ~ Marcel: Sorry about that but generally scholarships are highly competitive with several elimination criteria and sometimes even if you have the best grade you still find that you are not selected.
[08/05/2023, 18:41:39] ~ Miss Mogere: Most of the applications get rejected at UCD because they never look at them especially ones from Africa, so I’m told, try to make an appeal for the application you made something can work out

I'm currently doing research and results so far shows that 77% of international youths in Ireland are undergoing depression, only 20% knows the cause but the rest can't understand the cause.
We need to diseminate this research into our Kenyan community abroad🤣🙈😄
[11/06/2023, 22:08:52] ~ _Rams: 😂

[11/06/2023, 22:12:24] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: I love it coz it can really help...we have introverts out here who might be suffering silently 👏👏
[11/06/2023, 22:13:18] ~ Wanja Kimingi: And yes. People are battling depression and they don't know who to talk to. 

That's why I sent the message cause maybe someone else is feeling thes same way.
I just sent the message to encourage someone.

It's okay to cry and it okay reach out.
[11/06/2023, 22:14:47] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Exactly. People suffer silently. We all need a shoulder to lean on. Noone is an island, we all need each other.
[11/06/2023, 22:15:51] ~ Edna: Bet I need one ...
[11/06/2023, 22:16:17] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Exactly, I'm a trained peer educator, and guidance and counselor, if anyone feels smth heavy in their heart apart from instant money matters then might be there to give an ear, help whenever possible!!🫂🤪🙏
[11/06/2023, 22:17:32] ~ Wanja Kimingi: A shoulder to lean on? I can call you if you need someone to talk to.
[11/06/2023, 22:19:32] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Perfect!! Good to know we have a peer educators here.

Do that qualify to be therapist or?
[11/06/2023, 22:19:39] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Does**
[11/06/2023, 22:21:29] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Maybe to some, seeking help 😊☘️, giving hope
[11/06/2023, 22:24:04] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Alright.. Create awareness about mental health..

We all go through hell sometimes and it's okay to seek for help.
[11/06/2023, 22:24:41] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Atleast don't make anyone feel bad about seeking for help..
[11/06/2023, 22:25:01] ~ Chief: Can you share findings of this piece of work?
[11/06/2023, 22:25:09] ~ Wanja Kimingi: That's why most people don't talk about it cause they're afraid to be judged.
[11/06/2023, 22:28:15] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Sure,
[11/06/2023, 22:28:18] ~ Nn: I'm selling antidepressants tablets

[11/06/2023, 22:28:50] ~ Martin: I would be keen also to interact with this finding.
Good to hear we're quite a number of us here who are certified peer educators
[11/06/2023, 22:31:01] ~ Wanja Kimingi: And please share with us your study results. I'd really love to read your publication on the topic.
[11/06/2023, 22:31:10] ~ Kelv: Wewe unakaa one of them jijue kwanza 😂😂
[11/06/2023, 22:32:41] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Haha thank you. 

I don't think I need antidepressants though..
I'm just being cautious.
[11/06/2023, 22:33:03] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: The best antidepressant is natural and activity based:
Identify your hobby, hint about the cause of depression, start little by little, understand urself, live healthy...
These are just a broader points...further elaboration can help, mind and body zone building is the best one can do for stability in whatever you do!
[11/06/2023, 22:33:17] ~ Wanja Kimingi: You are also a peer educator?
Good to know. This is nice.
[11/06/2023, 22:34:23] ~ Nn: The only side effects ni utajua kumbe ulikuja kwa wenyewe kusaka Tongolos

[11/06/2023, 22:36:35] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: It's an article I interacted with during the mind and body including neurodiversityIreland zone Training we had. However, my publication is engineering related article! Sorry
[11/06/2023, 22:43:50] ~ Wanja Kimingi: That's awesome.. 

Mind sharing the article? If you have it that is.

Also all the best on the Engineering field. If it's biomedical engineering I can read your publications but the other engineering I'll be lost.
[11/06/2023, 22:47:10] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Sure, will go through the materials, whenever I find, I won't hesitate to share😊.
My field is food engineering related field, spectroscopy!
[11/06/2023, 22:49:59] ~ Wanja Kimingi: That's good to know.
I wish you the very best..

I'm into Biomedical engineering and regenerative medicine.

"Help, Assistance, support and being there for one another".
Let's identify some of your trusted friends whom u may share with your challenges!
[11/06/2023, 22:57:15] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Yes please..
And I hope and believe this encourages someone who is going through something.. Ask for help please. It's always okay to ask for help.
[11/06/2023, 22:58:24] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Caution:
Rem each and every1 of us are unique,
A friend who may help you financially may not solve your emotional challenge and vice versa,
One who can advise you spiritually may not be your best advisor in matters related to studies/ education and vice versa,
One who may syke you at work may fail to give you satisfaction in social life such as partying and vice versa..
Just learn about your friends and advisors, what they are bests in...be diverse enough and try to get the bests🙏🙏

[13/06/2023, 21:49:55] ~ Shel: Hi people ... Can one travel to London or more generally UK with an Ireland student visa?
[13/06/2023, 21:52:54] ~ CPA Nick Kandie: No, I think you need a British Visa
[13/06/2023, 22:02:59] ~ @marinepixels: Nope
[13/06/2023, 22:04:14] ~ Shel: Would I need to apply for a UK visa while I'm still in Kenya?
[13/06/2023, 22:05:13] ~ @marinepixels: If you coming to Ireland, then might be easier to do the application while here. Otherwise u can still apply for a UK visit visa in Kenya
[13/06/2023, 22:05:31] ~ _Rams: Wat I know is you can with resident id
[13/06/2023, 22:06:56] ~ Shel: Okay. Which one is easier? Or rather has a higher success rate?
[13/06/2023, 22:10:34] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Nope
[13/06/2023, 22:10:36] ~ @marinepixels: Unless its stamp 4, otherwise u need a visit visa

[13/06/2023, 22:10:59] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Anywhere,
[13/06/2023, 22:11:27] ~ @marinepixels: I wouldnt know honestly, just depends on ones circumstances
[13/06/2023, 22:12:25] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: I doubt...u still need visa even under stamp 4
[13/06/2023, 22:12:27] ~ Shel: Okay ... thanks
[13/06/2023, 22:14:33] Abda Torey: U hv a higher chance of getting if u apply from here…with ur IRP/GNIB card and lyk 2k euros.. it wil take you roughly 2 to 3 weeks
[13/06/2023, 22:14:56] Abda Torey: 2k balance in ur bank account

[13/06/2023, 23:43:09] ~ Nekesa: You can go to NI which is in the UK without any visa restrictions
[13/06/2023, 23:43:31] ~ @marinepixels: correct
[13/06/2023, 23:43:50] ~ Nekesa: Absolutely
[13/06/2023, 23:45:09] ~ Nekesa: The rest of the UK, you need a visa but Northern Ireland, you don’t
[13/06/2023, 23:46:30] ~ Nekesa: Hapa you are outrightly misleading…..
[13/06/2023, 23:47:45] ~ Faith Yegon: I think you still need a visa even with stamp 4..
[13/06/2023, 23:48:22] ~ Nekesa: The rest of the UK…..yes
The exception is NI
[13/06/2023, 23:49:22] ~ @marinepixels: Theres no exception for NI, legally one needs a UK visa only that there isnt border control esp. via the road
[13/06/2023, 23:51:05] ~ Nekesa: Be reminded that NI citizens are allowed by virtue of a referendum to hold both British & Irish passports, whichever suits one…,…translate that legally and politically.
[13/06/2023, 23:51:49] ~ Nekesa: Tuache to argue just juu ya mambo ya kuskia bana
[13/06/2023, 23:52:20] ~ 🧟‍♀️: Sorry for interference,Aki someone answer me this, I'm coming to ireland on a student visa, is it possible for my family to join me afterwards, and if its possible after how long, thanks
[13/06/2023, 23:54:36] ~ Nekesa: What level of study?
[13/06/2023, 23:55:07] ~ Nekesa: Juu PhD they can in your second yr
[13/06/2023, 23:55:21] ~ 🧟‍♀️: Masters
[13/06/2023, 23:56:08] ~ Nekesa: Hapa ni bahati bc remember MAs here is 1yr…..what’s your justification for wanting them to come??
[13/06/2023, 23:56:36] ~ Nekesa: But they can visit in the one yr duration depending on them getting granted visas
[13/06/2023, 23:58:04] ~ Faith Yegon: Once you complete your masters and hopefully get one of the critical skills jobs then they can join you permanently(not just visit) but if u get a general skill job you will have to work for one year before you can apply for family reunion visa.
[13/06/2023, 23:58:28] ~ 🧟‍♀️: Ooh ok and how long is the visit visa
[13/06/2023, 23:59:09] ~ Nekesa: 3 months
[13/06/2023, 23:59:13] ~ 🧟‍♀️: Thank you very much

[14/06/2023, 00:00:33] ~ HJ: Sometimes there tends to be checks at the border via bus
[14/06/2023, 00:00:35] ~ @marinepixels: That only applies to british passport area
[14/06/2023, 00:00:41] ~ @marinepixels: *holders
[14/06/2023, 00:42:45] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: At your own risk
[14/06/2023, 00:43:41] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Ok, please do, get the stamp 4 n give us experience, I'm talking from experience
[14/06/2023, 00:46:44] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: I had a Zambian friend who invited her husband and kid while doing masters 2021/22 cohort...it's possible but not more than three months. Proof of funds, n surety of going back home! Smth substantial
[14/06/2023, 00:49:32] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Exactly, I got a case where some patrols were being done a month ago and few Indian students (ladies) were found crossing to Belfast on a trip...so it's at your own risk... consult Ur ancestors always before making decisions... though the risks are very minimal, untill people takes it normal!
[14/06/2023, 09:02:41] ~ Nekesa: Eeeeeeeh!!! 
I know I told you sina stamp 4, shuuuwally, hiyo pia ni kitu ya kuambia watu kwa group?🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️


Basi please usiambie watu ulinipea food voucher on Sat, wacha tu nijisemee🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️
[14/06/2023, 09:05:14] ~ Nekesa: But anyways, even here am speaking from my Stamp2 experience…..

[14/06/2023, 09:09:22] ~ Nekesa: That having been said…..those interested to understand from an informed position na sio mambo ya kuambiwa, find time and read a document called the Northern Ireland Protocol……this will give you a fair picture of things.
[14/06/2023, 09:12:50] ~ Wanja Kimingi: You can use the revolut card. I used revolut card. So you should be fine.
[14/06/2023, 09:13:10] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Or what exactly is the problem?
[14/06/2023, 09:25:13] ~ Ruitha: Are you basing it on Common Travel Area between UK and Ireland?
[14/06/2023, 09:29:36] ~ Nekesa: Yes and in view of the fact that The Republic has issued you with a Residency Permit
[14/06/2023, 09:31:37] ~ Nekesa: And if you look at it, the Republic in its quest wanted to assume that the UK is a non-existent factor in how it relates with the North
[14/06/2023, 09:37:38] ~ @marinepixels: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit-ireland/british-irish-visa-scheme/ at the moment this only applies to Chinese and Indian nationals and yet to be rolled out to other countries. What does this mean, if you are Kenyan and have an Irish Residency permit, go to the UK without a visa at your own risk
[14/06/2023, 09:39:29] ~ .: Anyone who knows of any affordable student accomodation for a female student coming for the September intake? She will be attending Griffith college Dublin so if you hear of anything, please let me know
[14/06/2023, 09:39:45] ~ .: Thank you
[14/06/2023, 09:52:23] ~ Deflah: No. Kenyan passport holders still need a visa to UK
[14/06/2023, 09:52:50] ~ Deflah: Whether you hold Stamp 4 or 2.
[14/06/2023, 09:53:19] ~ Deflah: This includes Northern Ireland.

Even if caring for an elderly family member and include responsibilities ie assisting in daily living chores,prompting to take medication,  accompanying to and from doctor's appointments and recreational activities
[14/06/2023, 16:05:07] ~ Samuel Kaburu: Check out 'sample Irish cv' on Google. 
Different countries prefer different formats. 
Use a simple word format. Some of these are run through software which disqualifies you if it can't read fonts, images etc
Keep it simple

[22/06/2023, 12:38:51] ~ Arap Chebochok: Hello guys.. 
My appeal for you already there at Ireland being known the crisis in the land, kindly extend sympathy and empathy to the new coming students, atleast to have a soft landing there.. We are brothers and Sisters and believe me they won't forget your hospitality every other time..
[22/06/2023, 12:41:19] ~ chelie kogo: True 💯
[22/06/2023, 12:53:28] ~ Marcel: My "small" piece of advice but very "necessary" to  @353899547063 Nekesa  is that please critically analyse a post in  any public Wall before you comment on "everything".  Anyone  here who has done integrative literature reviews and thesis defense will tell you that this statement lacks "rigour", it's like a researcher who wants to test Null hypothesis but fails to employ ANOVA- T. We are not gagging you from commenting on everything but please be very sensitive especially on matters job and accomodation in this country because I have seen many Kenyans swing into depression because of the two factors.

[22/06/2023, 13:32:59] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: As you try to seek help from ur fellow Kenyans, try as well from the various websites by applying as many as possible. Similarly, be social to other nationalities, going for some meet-ups or pubs, u may meet an Irish or American who has connections who may easily help. Tuko city, so you try from all corners🙏🙏, otherwise if I get to hear any, I'll let you know.
[22/06/2023, 13:34:38] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: On the same note, I'm looking for a 1 or 2 or 3 bedroom apartment either in Dublin, Kildare or Kilkenny county, any links will be highly appreciated! It can help your fellow Kenyans in the future wakifika Ireland urgently 🙏🙏🙏

I'm not in Dublin.. but ice-cream on Sato can do..

But you know what will make me more than happy? It's to see your positive vibes. Support your sisters and brothers from Kenya and show them love..

Ikiwa ni jokes do it outside serious business. Differentiate when to joke and when to have a serious discussion.
Also don't bully people..

Be nice to people, be kind 😊

[22/06/2023, 17:30:42] ~ Wanja Kimingi: The urgent wasn't the problem actually..

If you being kind to yourself to just sit down and ask yourself where this whole thing came from hatungekuwa hapa..

But sasa wewe na ego yako huambiliki.
[22/06/2023, 17:31:44] ~ Wanja Kimingi: As longs as you are not mean to anyone Mimi sitakuwa na shida..

But ukikuwa mean, I will always point it out.
[22/06/2023, 17:32:07] ~ Nekesa: I said Wanja…..you know I always joke about that urgent thing but you and your ego wanted to use to whip emotions….. and get me your colony on your side
[22/06/2023, 17:32:50] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Perfect..

Then be kind to people. If you can't be kind then don't comment on their posts.
[22/06/2023, 17:33:05] ~ Nekesa: And btw the way, if you are honest with yourself and you want to help those from Kenya, help them to remove that word urgent, accommodation and Ireland in one sentence
[22/06/2023, 17:33:23] ~ Nekesa: Kind is what exactly???
[22/06/2023, 17:34:28] ~ Wanja Kimingi: It's an ego game now..

I don't play that game sweetheart..

Ask around, I take criticism very positively.. I care to ask where I wronged someone if I don't understand instead of acting defensive and worsening the whole thing.
[22/06/2023, 17:34:51] ~ Lyn💞: Exactly
[22/06/2023, 17:35:46] ~ Wanja Kimingi: As you said earlier, we express ourselves differently..

If the person decides to say urgently, what's the problem? Let them express themselves the best way they know how.
[22/06/2023, 17:36:35] ~ Wanja Kimingi: If you don't know the meaning then you can't be kind. Full stop 🛑
[22/06/2023, 17:37:06] ~ Nekesa: But Wanja, i always laugh about this urgent thing………all the time……and most guys know it’s a joke, why are you making sound like I was attacking guys who are struggling??

First of,  thanks to those of you that have reached out and yes, cyber bullying is real.
[23/06/2023, 17:45:30] ~ Nekesa: But my philosophy in life is that when we meet people, you decide the lesson you want to take away from them. 
And that winning is personal and a personal initiative of small factors that add up to one.

Like I have told some of you, this country has many problems but it’s also opportunity rich so don’t be afraid to go for what you want and believe in.

I have been in this country since September 24, 2023. ….and my journey has been amazing bc I am not afraid to dare……..my first major win, was contesting and winning an election overwhelmingly!

[25/06/2023, 15:36:37] ~ Tirus The Life CEO.: Good afternoon, guys.

Thank you so much to those who managed to attend yesterday's event. It was an honour to have met & interact with some of you.
We were able to discuss your shared experience and the challenges that you're facing here in Dublin, including but not limited to
▪️Housing crisis. 
▪️Students working hours.
▪️Mental health issues and / or depression 
▪️Travelling to the UK main island. 
▪️Post study visa & work permit etc etc

Myself, @⁨japeth JB, Tgram Global Scholarship⁩ @⁨Nekesa Labour candidates (TUD University), Ireland, Dublin⁩ and a few others managed to engage the ambassador and shared with him your concerns.
He agreed to meet up with us and brainstorm more on possible solutions to some common problems.

I am going to offer some of my services (I'll lay out the services that relate to you).

But I also urge all of you to stand up and be counted!
 Be part of the solutions and not the problem. Start thinking outside the box and adopt *a cup half-full mentality* because we are what we think about. 

Finally, listen to Brian Tracey talking about the power of your mind. 

Have a lovely Sunday afternoon. 

Tirus

[26/06/2023, 12:04:24] ~ Deirdre Quinn 👑: The culture day was OK . But I genuinely didn’t like the way my godfather was being forced to sign up for the consular services . He’s not even kenyan . The woman kept on forcing him even though he politely said no numerous times then eventually my godfather gave in . He wrote his name but didn’t wanna write down his details as he didn’t want to the contacted but the woman again tried to force him and then eventually understood the word no . This is not a good thing to see and was a let down and embarrassment for me . It spiked my anxiety and I left 20 mins after arriving . I live in Mayo (3 hours away) but I travelled from London and stayed an extra day to attend this event . Disappointed to say the least . Anyways well done on all your hard work on the day

[26/06/2023, 16:29:13] ~ Double D: Any vaccant rooms today?
[26/06/2023, 16:30:46] ~ Dee ✌🏾: Use DHL they deliver the documents in 2-3 days to Kenya. They are so good, use them all the time
[26/06/2023, 18:08:04] ~ KIPRUTO: Does anyone knows how to play cards with revenue concerning emergency tax if you have more than one job......feel free to inbox me please 🙏
[26/06/2023, 18:30:12] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Is it possible to have more than one employer on the same PPS number? How will that work on the revenue website?

Ukisaidika utuchanue sote.
Thank you.
[26/06/2023, 18:32:07] ~ Wanjikū: Think it’s easier calling the tax office and have them balance your tax credits. 
You can have two jobs on one PPSN.
[26/06/2023, 18:34:20] ~ JNN: Go to the revenue website, then divide your tax credit so as not to surpass 40k rate band
[26/06/2023, 18:34:36] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Ooh. Interesting. I didn't know it's possible. Thank you so much.

Then if it's possible for the emergency tax you just contact revenue either on phone or their website, on the enquiries tab..
[26/06/2023, 18:35:52] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Wow..
We learn each day.
Thank you.
[26/06/2023, 18:38:25] ~ KIPRUTO: Thank you 😊
[26/06/2023, 18:46:15] ~ HJ: They (some agents) will tell you over the phone to do it with Myaccount, so just tell them you’ve tried and couldn’t hack it, they’d do it for you over the phone and they’ll ask you how you want to split it.
[26/06/2023, 18:59:52] ~ Essie: It’s not a must you split. You can have one main job, and still do the other, credits will automatically be calculated at 40k band then from there to be calculated as usual.

[26/06/2023, 19:42:46] ~ Kelv: 40hour will never change 😂😂😂
[26/06/2023, 19:46:19] ~ Tina: It depends on which stamp you hold. Is it possible to do two jobs with a Stamp 1G or it can bring issues when renewing?
[26/06/2023, 20:47:51] ~ EJK Technologies: Stamp 2
[26/06/2023, 20:47:54] ~ EJK Technologies: Ngori
[26/06/2023, 21:04:34] ~ Wanjikū: You can work more than 40hours in whatever stamp your on. Just depends on the kind of job you get.

[26/06/2023, 23:30:20] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Sure, but for those in stamp 1G, and 1 is a risk...more so 1, 1 G is understandable...further explanation we can hold a voice call
[26/06/2023, 23:31:00] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Just strict on the process, so they'll never tell u other side of the story
[26/06/2023, 23:33:55] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Great one, you can do that but a risk more so if u fail to secure a work permit in Ur first year, coz when renewing the stamp atimes, they check through the history...job applications, interviews and 40hrs a week rule
[26/06/2023, 23:35:57] ~ New Era🇰🇪🌍🇮🇪🌄: Disclaimer; "I don't know everything" but talking from bit of experience and sharing some knowledge I got from other guys, some time back...in relation to other people's scenarios. Doesn't mean it final, we learn and explore everyday
[27/06/2023, 00:40:35] ~ Tina: It's impossible on stamp 2 during class sessions employers won't even allow it. Maybe now in the summer shule zikifungwa    you can do the 40hrs or more so take advantage for the next 3 months until summer ends and make enough money 😅
[27/06/2023, 00:42:54] ~ EJK Technologies: Well my employers would but how abt them tracking my payments since they will both be via ppsn?
[27/06/2023, 00:45:12] ~ Tina: That's the work of revenue not your employers. Just give them the Ppsn number. But call revenue to inform them

[27/06/2023, 08:51:32] ~ Mel: Hopefully, this decision will not cause an increase in Civil Wars in the continent. An example is the recent "coup" attempt in Russia. The American bankers will make moves to prevent/slow the move away from the replacement of their dollar
[27/06/2023, 08:52:37] ~ shillah: Let's hope for the best
[27/06/2023, 09:04:53] ~ CPA Nick Kandie: I think this might be a good move for African states but also risky. America will try as much as possible to stop this rise of Africa currency supremacy, just like what happened in Libya under Gaddafi, this week, we saw a coup attempt in Russia because of BRICS.
This thing will ultimately succeed if all the 54 African states combine, otherwise Kenya alone can't champion for the creation of AFREXIMBANK. America will deal with Kenya as they dealt with Libya in late 2011

Once you have everything drop the documents at the embassy and wait for 6 to 8weeks.

It has been fully funded by Irish government if you have stamp 4 or an Irish citizen. However if you have other stamps like 1g and above you are given 90% discount on fee. It has future prospects in food, medical and agricultural industries as things nowadays are becoming automated. If interested, mostly the postgraduates who are in STEM can consider reaching out on me for further links.

Register your account and follow the instructions. All the docs needed are listed as well.
For people like me who are wondering what about graduation, talk to your course coordinator on the rules concerning completion letter like when and how to get it. 
You will also need new health insurance if yours expires by September.

Hope it helps 😃

‎[07/07/2023, 09:38:33] ~ Lopytigz: ‎image omitted

[07/07/2023, 09:42:48] Lyn Dublin Kenyan: Do you have it in an account? 
If yes you can use the revolut app. 
Its $ 1 = €.91
[07/07/2023, 09:44:13] ~ Shel: So according to my quick calculations, with dollars, I'd get more euros if I changed the cash in Ireland than in Kenya. Or am I wrong? I find Kenyan banks greedy
[07/07/2023, 09:45:30] ~ Shel: Kenyan banks would first convert the cash to kshs then tk euros. For example the current rate at Absa is $1 = 0.83 euros
[07/07/2023, 09:46:11] ~ Shel: No ... I'm thinking of a scenario where I have it in cash
[07/07/2023, 09:50:21] ~ Shel: Aaaaahh...this is waaaay cheaper

That’s why they do it that way.
[07/07/2023, 10:28:03] ~ Shel: ... yeah. So it's wise to avoid that conversion coz the kenyan shilling is performing poorly. Right?

[13/07/2023, 21:02:55] ~ Gentle Giant: We need to define what a transit is.

People are getting confused here for no reason.
[13/07/2023, 21:06:08] ~ Martin: Transit visa not required if you:
1) Are a Kenyan national
2) Have a single ticket to your final destination &;
3) Connection is within the same airport - Schipol AMS, Paris CDG &  Heathrow LHR

Confusion I think comes when folks use split tickets and assume the same conditions apply to a single ticket - the latter being where, for example, your baggage is checked in to your final destination.

Also if you have a friend with different nationality that experienced the same - for example last I checked Nigerian Nationals need a transit visa to pass through Paris CDG. 

There is one slightly more complex case - usually created via the great websites Expedia et al.

Sometimes you get a "cheaper" ticket with more than one connection between NBO and DUB. If the two connections are within the Schengen area - you will need a visa because all intra-Schengen-area flights are considered domestic - so to cross from your inbound international flight to your  next intra-schengen connection you would have to cross immigration. You will again cross immigration for the last connection out of the Schengen area.

To be  visa free via the EU Schengen area both your inbound and outbound flight must be to / from destinations outside the schengen area. This will generally be true for Nairobi to Dublin flights via Amsterdam (KLM), Paris (Air France). Should also apply via Frankfurt (Luftansa)

UK springs up issues because British Airways operates out of both Heathrow and Gatwick airports, both in London - so on occassion they offer you the first leg Nairobi to Heathrow and a Dublin connection from Gatwick. That needs a visa. ( it will typically be a cheaper ticket, but the cost of moving to Gatwick - ~60km away but by rail - plus the visa make it more expensive in the long run)

[09/08/2023, 21:56:02] ~ ~Robert: give it 5yrs or so, they will be literally be begging people to rent and buy their houses. Developers are busy pumping more investments hoping to cash in on the crisis and consequently creating an over-supply

There were also young boys spotted at the Liffey river with machetes casually walking around the city centre. Kindly take care of yourselves and trust your intuition. I know many of us like having our headphones 🎧 and earpieces on when we are walking in town but be very aware of your surrounding. You could end up being injured simply because you were on site when the commotion was happening. Take care of yourselves and God will protect us as well 🙏

You could have a slight argument with someone for something as small as bumping on each other when walking and they pull out a knife 🔪. Keep in mind we are black people they could also change the narrative on you. Let's handle some situations with wisdom.

[13/09/2023, 19:42:56] ~ Ali: Hi Admin, 

Am Ali Abdi, a Kenyan Nurse
Coming to a hospital in Dublin soon. 

I got stuck by getting accommodation. My agency wants me to pay accommodation but will re-emberse later on upon arrival in Ireland. 

I'm seeking help in regards to accommodation alternatives as this is costly for my case and the embassy requires me to provide evidence of accommodation address for visa approval.

In addition, if in this group there's Somali community members  or if you have/know friends kindly let me know. 

I'll appreciate your positive feedback 

Thank you
[13/09/2023, 20:08:07] ~ Abidabu: Ali Salam aleikoum 
Here we don’t have tribes or community we all Kenyans :)

[13/09/2023, 20:22:21] ~ 📯: @~AVO  Its inappropriate to insult my people and honest parents doing their jobs .You are the criminal mind here,'the GIVER of money' .the notion everyone in Kenya is ignorant if things dont go your way is laughable@Alazar..Satan is simply doing his part,to TEST.he came to kill,steal and destroy.If You dint stand up to defend what the Lord God had given you with truth but instead let satan instill fear in you and put desperation in your heart,then am sorry you failed the test of Faith at the most crucial time at the "Final"exit point at the airport.(many go to their knees praising God at this exit point,remembering where the've come from)You dint fight back with the Truth of the one who made you reach that final point.You BOUGHT the fear😂😂😂,dont point at immigration officers😂🤔#ancientSatan

[13/09/2023, 20:56:45] ~ Dennis Muhika.: Nowhere was there an insult in that video. 

Unless you leave on Mars, Kenyans is largely a corrupt country especially when dealing with government officials. It's very naive of you to think otherwise. 

Second, how Satan was brought to this scenario baffles me. We can't be  blaming Satan for every misfortune, and finding him in every nook and cranny  thinking he is the subtle force behind all wicked events and encounters. It's the age-old conspiracy mentality. Unless you're one, leave that to fanatics.

Lastly, not everyone subscribes to religion/faith. Please, keep it personal.

I need help😂. I have mpesa balance which I forgot to transact before leaving 254. How do I send it to either bank or another mpesa number?
[25/09/2023, 09:40:16] ~ EJK Technologies: Safaricom app
[25/09/2023, 09:40:25] ~ 💥Sparks💥: Let me add that I do not have mpesa app😂
[25/09/2023, 09:40:38] ~ EJK Technologies: Uko ma simcard ?

[25/09/2023, 09:40:51] ~ 💥Sparks💥: Yes
[25/09/2023, 09:41:07] ~ 💥Sparks💥: Let me try
[25/09/2023, 09:41:15] ~ Lawrence😎: *334# works well if you don't have the app
[25/09/2023, 09:42:07] ~ EJK Technologies: Nunua credit ya 200 or get someone to buy you . Download and activate Safaricom app and you’re good to go . It will be roaming but once that’s done uko sawa . Have done it a couple of times . Then if you ever need M-PESA you’re sorted
[25/09/2023, 09:43:48] ~ Ali: By the way is there a way you register your simcard to avoid your phone being given to someone else. I heard your phone can be given to another client.
Any idea?
[25/09/2023, 09:46:56] ~ Cornelius: Your phone? Wataikujia kwa nyumba ama

[25/09/2023, 10:14:35] ~ Sirdk_: It will still not work because he has to use his line data inorder to merge his line and the mpesa app .
[25/09/2023, 10:15:07] ~ Brunos Nyakundi: Ooh yes
[25/09/2023, 10:38:14] ~ Thuku: Hi morning,who is in griffith doing  MSC IBM?

[25/09/2023, 10:57:53] ~ 💥Sparks💥: Will try again later. The app requires I have the mobile data on but which is not working. Could be because I was on postpay upto end of this month? Just guessing.
[25/09/2023, 11:00:53] ~ Erico: Check whether you turned on data roaming. You can do this on your apple device(not sure about android) by navigating through cellular data options in your settings and turn on roaming.

[29/09/2023, 11:06:05] ~ Dee ✌🏾: “I am renting out 1 single room in a 3bed house in Stamullen. 

It will be more convenient for people who drive - however- we have a train station in Gormanston which is a 20min walk from my house. Train is frequent + less than 40mins by train to reach city centre
Stamullen is a 5min drive to the M1, and it takes 25mins to drive to city centre. 

The room will have its own private bathroom usage.
House is modern & clean. Its a relaxed house with each other’s space respected. 
Sharing with one other person. In her 40’s. 

Looking for a matured person who is genuinely relaxed, clean & tidy. 

Price: 650e with bills included. 
Duration: 3-6months. Option to extend after review in 3-6months”

Right now they have started to be abit strict, checked my documents in UK airport in contrary to my previous travel! Let's hope they ease the visa issue
[31/10/2023, 11:46:48] ~ Naomi.: Mtu anisaidie kuclarify.

So it says “You do not need an ETA if ALL of the following apply.
Then the second one is “If you do not need a visa to enter UK”
[31/10/2023, 11:48:50] ~ ~Robert: It might take time to reflect if it is a new update but i would suggest for anyone intending to travel to confirm with the UK home office official website gov.uk

[01/11/2023, 21:09:49] ~ Obura: Yes, You need a Uk visa.
Unlike Ryanair airlines, aerlingus airline hardly check for the visa and this can be a good cheat sheet but too risky.

This morning I checked through aer Lingus airline,no one checked my visa.
[01/11/2023, 21:11:01] ~ EJK Technologies: So entering UK . When they stamp .. they don’t check ? They are only checking from the airlines ?
[01/11/2023, 21:22:43] ~ ~Robert: Great, this is what I expected.
[01/11/2023, 21:51:00] ~ Jimmmen RO: No checking of visa flights from Ireland, that responsibility is for the airline to Check that passengers have the right credentials. Its a special agreement between UK and Ireland however, when you come back, the Irish immigration will check when you land at Dublin or any other airport in Ireland
[01/11/2023, 21:51:49] ~ Jimmmen RO: In Europe is totally different,  no such agreement in place
[01/11/2023, 22:22:33] ~ Obura: I was en route to the USA, Are lingus airline didn't check my visa , but I went through the USA clearance desk which verified my visa and the purpose of the visit.

I equally have used aer Lingus airline to UK in several occasions,they hardly check the visa. But I always have a valid visa just in case things go south.

[02/11/2023, 01:43:30] ~ Tina: So I wonder what that update on the UK website was for. Did you show it to them when asking?
[02/11/2023, 01:48:14] ~ Obura: Yes I inquired about this, remember recently UK increased immigrants visa application fee and this could be among the many updates.
[02/11/2023, 09:18:06] ~ ~Robert: I guess the ETA only applies to some countries e.g. EU citizens and a few others. Sisi wengine tutaendelee kuwapatia pesa watupatie visa

[02/11/2023, 10:26:43] ~ brian: It doesn't say that though. Says as long as you are a resident in Ireland..

I see the update was done on 25th, so maybe it's too soon to know how it's implemented. Costs 10 euros to apply though, I will apply for it and see.
[02/11/2023, 10:28:06] ~ ~Robert: There has been conversation between the UK and Irish governments to allow visit visa holders to travel freely within the CTA, so I am certain if it is not in place then it is in the pipeline.

[02/11/2023, 12:11:36] ~ Essie: Your driving license is the best for ferry , student card best for belfast
[02/11/2023, 12:12:07] ~ Essie: Land in small airports like stanstend, Luton etc. don’t try Heathrow
[02/11/2023, 12:13:18] ~ ~Robert: Baaasi, unajipata unakula relief food
[02/11/2023, 12:13:45] ~ Tina: Kwani Belfast haitaji kwenda na visa? A group of Indian students were on a road trip wakaingia northern Ireland wote walikuwa arrested.They shared their experience in another forum
[02/11/2023, 12:15:04] ~ ~Robert: It is clear and we all agree that there are many routes to entry. The key point to consider is to avoid any situation that will bring you in contact with border force officials or the police😃😃
[02/11/2023, 12:15:40] ~ mirokedi dickson: Hapo sasa
[02/11/2023, 12:15:44] ~ Essie: Ab done it few times, never hai been checked in belfast. Ferry if driving they only check your license on your way back. Kwenda no body cares. Flights to belfast either going or coming back no check point. Just have light luggage
[02/11/2023, 12:16:10] ~ ~Robert: Hawana nyota, it is a risk undertaking though. I have done it several times with clear knowledge of the risks
[02/11/2023, 12:18:15] ~ ~Robert: I am curious to know the consequences after the arrest. Any idea?
[02/11/2023, 12:22:06] ~ Tina: After some investigations they were deported back to the republic of Ireland. So in the forum they were seeking advice if they were now marked and if that incidence will affect their Visa application to UK in the future.
[02/11/2023, 12:23:13] ~ Kul Events LTD: Hawa kuna venye walifanya, personally I've gone to Belfast many times bila visa na IRP card, nkafanya shugli zangu na kurudi na amani 😅😅
[02/11/2023, 12:24:57] ~ Martin: Mkubwa hizo shugli zilikua gani😂😂
[02/11/2023, 12:25:16] ~ ~Robert: I see, at least not to the Kagame camps. The UK and EU have a more or less similar platform for sharing security and intelligence information and based on that, they are likely to be marked in their future visa applications
[02/11/2023, 12:26:13] ~ Kul Events LTD: 😅😅😅😅 Hawasemi kwa forum 😅😅
[02/11/2023, 12:26:26] ~ Tina: Just be careful you're taking a risk
[02/11/2023, 12:30:57] ~ Martin: Some of us are risk-averse,that why i prefer having my visa.
The only risk i take ni

[08/11/2023, 12:51:10] ~ ~Robert: Try to remove all price tags and wrappings for any small gifts on your suitacase (this isnt an assurance that your bag won't be marked but as a mitigation measure). If u buy any new electronic gadgets, you can claim for a tax refund at the airport/country of departure (to avoid double taxation on arriving at JKIA.

U can’t claim tax refund
[08/11/2023, 13:08:00] ~ ~Robert: mostly it applies for those travelling, and u might explore the possibility for those on student visas
[08/11/2023, 13:08:37] ~ Tina: The solution here is removing all the tags on the clothes, shoes etc and let them look like your normal luggage. The only problem will be with the electronics coz you will have to prove to them that they've been in use.
[08/11/2023, 13:09:38] ~ Abigael Ohingo: Is it the Cumulative cost of all items or is it the cost of 1 item?
[08/11/2023, 13:10:01] ~ ~Robert: I hear they ask people to turn on their gadget to verify that they were in use. Toa tags and weka kwa bag pack

If there are any students on stamp 2A, please DM me your details…..I know there are two from TU Dublin but if there are any that you know, let me know…..thanks

Especially those over 18 bc I meant to understand the universities can’t intervene when you are under 18 ‎<This message was edited>

[08/11/2023, 20:03:14] ~ Tina: I thought children born of Kenyan citizens abroad are already Kenyans Because in some countries for example Ireland you are not automatically a citizen if born here. That child will get citizenship after residing in Ireland for 3 or 4 yrs. So does it mean they'll be stateless unless you pay 1M to the Kenyan govt?

If he was so straightforward and honest, he’d have not been party to the SGR and Eurobond loots. To relentlessly tell us that Ruto is at any one point going to fix the problems he is party to is a lie. We must try and understand that the collective problem we have is that of political elitism and followers who are so periodically blinded to see how this is hurting them. Ruto cannot be separated from the woes that face our country. And he cannot be the one to offer a solution.
[10/11/2023, 14:22:51] ~ Kirwa~D....: absolutely; thats how to define a working government for its citizens....you cannot tax everything and remove all subsidies in the name of assisting kenyans...mediocre presidents do that

Why scrab free education? And University Funding Model?

As we speak, increased illiteracy will create bigger problems for the country.

BTW one year into office what can we say they have done?

Kibaki one month into office we had free education.

The current one?
[10/11/2023, 14:28:22] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: Deputy president for ten years and now president.

So should we say he is the PROBLEM?
[10/11/2023, 14:29:24] ~ Thuku: 100% correct.Ruto was part of the gang,but for anyone to say Uhuru meant well for kenyans is a joke taken too far.In 2013 the debt was 1.8 trillion and he left it at over 8 trillion.Almost half was stolen/misappropriated.
[10/11/2023, 14:30:09] ~ Thuku: And we are now paying dearly for it

[10/11/2023, 14:33:22] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: Debt isn't a problem. We can easily borrow to refinance it. As long we have a stable economic environment, investors will always invest in government bonds.

But the current regime has f**d up the economic environment that it has become pretty expensive to raise additional debt. See the current yields on Kenyan debt.

Who has messed the economic environment with punitive taxation)

[10/11/2023, 14:37:15] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: From a privileged point of view.

Can you pay enough for ARVs if left alone? Or tuseme can you afford to build a road or a hospital since you have to pay for the service?

Government borrow to finance their budgets
[10/11/2023, 14:38:08] ~ jacktie.k: This one here is paid and probably in kes. How do increase a service charge by 2000% and a same time not providing the same people you want to charge a source of income?
[10/11/2023, 14:39:39] ~ Senator: How can you have investors who sabotage the people,,,,,,,,,chemelili,muhoroni,mumias and nzoia sugar collapsed because of investors who came and sabotaged farmers by importing sugar and rebranding
[10/11/2023, 14:40:48] ~ Sylva: And Kenyans have been paying their taxes since independence. This idea that we need to suddenly be overtaxed doesn’t is far from the truth. Rampant gov’t expenditure and massive corruption is where the issue is. Hata tupeane pesa yetu yote, as long as hawatatosheka na pesa yao itakuwa kazi bure. Since Kibaki left, it’s clear that 1st terms are for stealing and amassing wealth, then 2nd term ni ya kudanganya wananchi na projects mbili tatu.
[10/11/2023, 14:41:10] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: Haaaa it's because of people who elect leaders based on their surnames and not on the quality of their profiles.

We are in this now because of people who voted interestingly in the last election.
[10/11/2023, 14:42:22] ~ Senator: Yeah 2000% you are right because the price of the product in the world need you to pay that 2000 but initially you were getting @ 0% reality hits hard bro
[10/11/2023, 14:42:45] ~ Thuku: One thing which is 100% true is that Raila would have never been the better option.Thats the truth.

[10/11/2023, 14:45:48] ~ Sylva: Again, that’s what you said in 2013. Ten years down the line mnasema Uhuru was a bad option. Now you voted for Ruto saying Raila wasn’t an option but a few years to come bado mtasema Ruto was a bad call. This is the unfortunate trend that keep on recurring every electioneering period.
[10/11/2023, 14:46:18] ~ Thuku: Where was he to get 6k to dish out🤔🤔🤔.That was a campaign gimmick
[10/11/2023, 14:46:21] ~ Erico: 😂😂
[10/11/2023, 14:46:57] ~ Tina: Like I said this is just kageges thinking. And that's how they are consoling themselves. We know very well how Raila worked well with kibaki in the coalition government it was the best government.
[10/11/2023, 14:47:14] ~ Thuku: But that is the fact,Raila was not a good option.We need to elect leaders who will work for us

[10/11/2023, 14:52:31] ~ Francis: What I know is, whether you kithni or ndikni, Ruto has the best interests of Kenyans at heart. How to actualize these interests ndio hajui..
[10/11/2023, 14:52:44] ~ Lewis: You really buy this stuff politicians say on podiums? I argue that you have a right to express your opinion. It should not include, however, forcing on us what is political hearsay. I am still waiting for this government to prosecute Uhuru Kenyatta, and Raila Odinga for economic crimes. When they do it, then we can have a national conversation about who looted and who did not. Otherwise, I see no reason, to insinuate with certainty that you could foretell our future had Odinga become President. I am content with one that says that they do not know what could have been. The one who defends incompetence, I am not.
[10/11/2023, 14:53:18] ~ Tina: Please don't force your opinion on us.
[10/11/2023, 14:53:32] ~ Senator: You are the one buying but what i see with ruto now is not politics it's transformation
[10/11/2023, 14:54:05] ~ mirokedi dickson: Point in brother
[10/11/2023, 14:54:06] ~ Senator: True bro
[10/11/2023, 14:55:09] ~ Sylva: Boss hana. His personal interests and goals of being President, yes. But interest ya Mkenya sahau. Hana.
[10/11/2023, 14:55:54] ~ Lewis: Your opinion on this matter is valid, to the extent that you do not push it down our throats. My opinion is that KK is incompetent and disconnected from the hopes and aspirations of the people who elected them.

[10/11/2023, 14:57:51] ~ Sylva: Even Kibaki’s era when Kenya recorded a huge transformation, Kenyans were not ‘strangled’ this way.
[10/11/2023, 14:58:15] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: 😀😀😀
[10/11/2023, 14:58:18] ~ Senator: Who knows🤔

[10/11/2023, 14:58:56] ~ Lewis: Point us to the reports my friend. I would like to read these things you say would implicate Odinga and Uhuru and leave Ruto out of it. Do not be vague.
[10/11/2023, 14:59:26] ~ Rama😇: Yeah l support Ruto but huyu mzee alikuwa red flag tangu day one aki anza his political journey 
Kama Angefanya scandal while ni Mp what about saa hii ako kwa power
[10/11/2023, 14:59:33] ~ Senator: But you voted him out if not struggle hangerudi😂😂😂
[10/11/2023, 14:59:44] ~ Thuku: There is no where I have exonerated Ruto,I said he was part of the gang.
[10/11/2023, 15:00:24] ~ Lewis: I would like to debate with facts. Point me to the reports, I asked. It is not that hard now, is it?
[10/11/2023, 15:00:34] ~ Senator: I don't know but you are a victim of tears when taxes  are introduce
[10/11/2023, 15:01:43] ~ Sylva: There must have been a reason why he was voted out. Even some people have forced themselves in and that’s the unfortunate side of democracy.
[10/11/2023, 15:02:35] ~ Thuku: Just Google audit reports on kemsa,Telekom sale
[10/11/2023, 15:03:35] ~ Thuku: Read the audit report on eurobond by ouko
[10/11/2023, 15:03:54] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: By the way, should we reveal that Ruto and Mzee might have had a deal already? 

They are all ODM ama?
[10/11/2023, 15:04:25] ~ Senator: I thought because alileta change you could vote him without stealing votes😂😂😂😂 anyway change isn't felt immediately but you will see after loosing the person who brings change
[10/11/2023, 15:05:06] ~ Sylva: Thing is it’s not about me, it’s about the majority Kenyans who live under 1 dollar a day. The ‘hustlers’ that you promised heaven but have served them hell instead. Someone said middle class is the problem when it comes to issues affecting Kenya, and to some extent I agree with him. We assume if it doesn’t affect/hurt me, then it’s ok.
[10/11/2023, 15:08:14] ~ Senator: Heaven is not a walk in park 😂😂😂 remember ngazi lazima ikuwe ndio Hawa wafike mbinguni na ngazi ikitengenezwa lazima nails ikuwe,nyundo,mbao,fundi etc eventually after setting it they will reach where they were promised it's a matter of time,
[10/11/2023, 15:09:57] ~ Senator: Hata kanisa utaingia na upelekwe mbinguni you must be reading bible daily,praying and practice all that you are doing ndio uende mbingu 😂😂😂😂
[10/11/2023, 15:10:03] ~ Sylva: 🤣🤣🤣🤣Ok. Maombi yangu ni Mwenyezi Mungu atupe uhai tufike 2032 halafu tufanye tathmini ya tunayoyazungumzia hii leo.

[10/11/2023, 15:11:05] ~ Senator: Exactly
[10/11/2023, 15:11:09] ~ Sylva: Kama Kibaki alilazmisha akarudi, na Ruto je?

[10/11/2023, 15:12:13] ~ Senator: Mtashagaa jua Ako na system+deep state last time hakuwa na any
[10/11/2023, 15:13:08] ~ Sylva: That’s my point.
[10/11/2023, 15:13:25] ~ Nesta: Half ya bunge ni UDA akuna vile tunaeza impeach ruto
[10/11/2023, 15:13:29] ~ Senator: What I advice Ronald wekesa is that just keep your vote in the house and wait for the results
[10/11/2023, 15:14:33] ~ Senator: 2027 votes will be digital tutatumia finger print and eye 👀
[10/11/2023, 15:15:04] ~ Senator: We don't need you in polling station 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
[10/11/2023, 15:15:37] ~ Sylva: By ‘we’ you mean nyinyi as deep state right?🤣
[10/11/2023, 15:16:39] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: @353894828218 Atleast you don't speak for my mother and other hustlers who wholeheartedly voted in UDA hoping for change.
[10/11/2023, 15:17:59] ~ Senator: At least you don't speak for better tomorrow for Kenya and kenyans
[10/11/2023, 15:18:51] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: What do you mean. You more Kenyan than me?
[10/11/2023, 15:20:01] ~ Senator: We are both Kenyan 🫰🏼
[10/11/2023, 15:21:15] ~ Senator: But give cesar what belongs to cesar
[10/11/2023, 15:21:19] ~ Ronald Wekesa Wafula: So we should all be cheerleaders for UDA for introducing the mighty tax system and overhauling key sectors where people have to fund themselves like Education?
[10/11/2023, 15:22:12] ~ Senator: Pay tax to get services game short
[10/11/2023, 15:27:11] ~ Tina: Paying tax is no problem every nation does it. Over taxation to an extent of chasing away investors is the problem. Why do you think rich countries like Ireland do to attract investors? It's a tax heaven large corporations and multinationals are here set up here creating so much wealth and employment to locals and foreigners like us. Many of us here work in those corporations an opportunity maybe we would not get if we were in Kenya
[10/11/2023, 15:31:29] ~ Sylva: Mi hata nimenyamaza coz naona watu wana selective amnesia.
[10/11/2023, 15:31:45] ~ Senator: What have they overtaxed

[10/11/2023, 15:35:01] ~ Tina: Sasa wewe do I have to explain to you those decisions? Just read widely
[10/11/2023, 15:36:46] ~ Senator: Highlight so that I can understand because you know better
[10/11/2023, 15:37:09] ~ Tina: Like I said read widely
[10/11/2023, 15:42:21] ~ Abidabu: Ireland has super high taxes 
Open and run a business here my fren then u will understand the tex code 
Don’t be fooled by PAYE 
Also if ur in higher tax bracket you pay between 42-52% of income to finance the welfare state 
So high is relative 
So is low
Multinationals play a lot of tax evasion most of them have offshore accounts 
Nway I’m short try run a business here then we can have the tax discussion.
[10/11/2023, 15:44:27] ~ Tina: There's a relief for big corporations just checked out why most of them are set up here. I wasn't talking about PAYE
[10/11/2023, 15:45:38] ~ Abidabu: That’s the initial tax
You pay the first 12.5 % and you pay graduated tax above that

[10/11/2023, 16:14:34] ~ David: You are typing like the beneficiary of the looting in Kenya by this Ruto government.
[10/11/2023, 16:15:10] ~ Jimmmen RO: They are looters, Ruto started in YK92' kenyans dont research, dont read, and dont search the archives to see the real pictures of these fake leadership,  let kenyans suffer and be more poorer, as long as they vote their tribe, they should not claim racism when they come to diaspora, Africa and kenya unfortunately is grim state of affairs
[10/11/2023, 16:26:44] ~ Senator: 😂😂😂 whoever support government is beneficiary of looting
[10/11/2023, 16:27:51] ~ Senator: 😂😂😂😂 and that's Kenya politics
[10/11/2023, 16:28:57] ~ A~lee: I second. 
A good citizen should be a critique to the sitting authority immediately after election. 
Irregardless of your previous choice in the ballot
[10/11/2023, 16:30:10] ~ Senator: True but again you must support the same government to implement
[10/11/2023, 16:31:18] ~ A~lee: You can't support while demanding for change!! Choose one! Either become a " boot leaker" or demand for change

I have affordable courses for you and.your person can come to do either an undergraduate or a master's program.

There is a January intake and this month is the best for your person to get his/her visa by first week of January.

Is this a deal?

Please reach out.

Ronald

[13/11/2023, 10:26:35] ~ Gods Favour: He can negotiate with the bank in terms of exchange rates.
[13/11/2023, 11:06:26] ~ P.K Tunge: If the system uses tranfermate then he/ she need to fill the form then take it to the bank and uses to pay.
[13/11/2023, 11:07:21] ~ P.K Tunge: Of all the bank kcb is the onley one which gives a better rate.so long as the money is above 2000 dollars....kitu 300k na kwenda juu
[13/11/2023, 11:07:55] ~ P.K Tunge: Or directly if the school gave out the bank account
[13/11/2023, 11:10:08] ~ Gods Favour: Exactly, I used Kcb
[13/11/2023, 11:12:46] ~ P.K Tunge: Also if the person is carrying the money cash he can also look for the good rate outside after knowing the rate at bank ..he can save alot when the difference is 1 bob.kama ni  5k dollars hapo utapata 5ksh

[13/11/2023, 11:37:37] ~ HR✍️: It seems payment mode for DBS is through flywire for all international students. Flywire is expensive. It will be a total of 2, 316, 000

[13/11/2023, 11:39:38] ~ HR✍️: It is saying all International sdts going through agents should be pay via flywire. It requires 2, 316,000 against the 2.2m from bank to bank transfer
[13/11/2023, 11:39:57] ~ HR✍️: Can you advise please?
[13/11/2023, 11:41:38] ~ F: So far Family Bank, NCBA and Bank of Africa has affordable rate but you need to have an account with them in order to transfer that money
[13/11/2023, 11:43:16] ~ P.K Tunge: I dont understand your statement .but what i know is ....the money you have then based on the rate of the bank(prefferably kcb) then plus transfer charge of 2300ksh
[13/11/2023, 11:43:18] ~ Total Lady Totich: Kcb the best and you can negotiate the rates

Dear Esteemed customer.
Hope you are well.
We are thrilled to announce the launch of our latest prime project, Sagana Prime. After taking into account your feedback, we have chosen a strategic location for this project - directly opposite the popular “Kwa-samaki” area and touching the 4-lane dual-carriageway Kenol-Sagana Highway.

 Don't wait any longer to be a part of this flourishing location. With fully fenced plots, water and electricity readily available, has red Soil, Sagana Prime offers everything you need to start building your dream property. And for a limited time, we are offering an early bird price of only 999K for cash payments and 1.19 for installments. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to invest in Sagana Prime!

Somehow you got it through some corrupt means. 
Eveybody, please desist from using it to demonstrate you have accommodation in Ireland.  You do not have permission to do so.

If this letter was supplied to you please get in touch before I take action which will have consequences including legal implications. This is your  chance. 
And if you were planning to use it, cease and desist.  It will result in denial of your visa application.

Hope you are keeping well. 

As you may be wondering, the chat function has been disabled until further notice. 

This group chat was created for the purpose of young Kenyans in Ireland to connect from a place of respect and to build a strong community. 

However the chat has been filled with a lot of spam messages that were not intended for this forum over the last few weeks and months. 

We would like to strongly discourage members from sharing for example the personal information of anyone whether that person is in or not in this group chat. 

Due to the legal severity of this matter that has been raised with us we have decided to disable the chat function until this has been resolved and we have found a working system with guidelines on what will be allowed to be posted on the group chat moving forward.

The chat function will be reopened as soon as this is complete so there is no need to message admins privately about when this will be opened. 

Thank you.

Aisha, Yvonne, Ian and Jeff. 🇰🇪 🇮🇪

[26/11/2023, 22:22:20] ~ Jeff Otengo: Hello everyone, 

We trust you are all doing well, particularly given the recent riots in Dublin.  

As mentioned last week, we had to disable the comment section of this group due to an investigation related to the unauthorized sharing of an individual's private information. Emphasizing the seriousness of this issue, we kindly request those who have accessed or still have the document on their devices to promptly delete it from both phones and computers. Additionally, if the document was forwarded to other groups, make sure to alert those groups and ask them to delete it promptly. An external investigation into this matter is ongoing. 

Additionally, as previously specified, we've introduced the following guidelines for the group. Given the substantial growth of the group since 2020, we recognize the significance of having established rules. These rules are in place to safeguard everyone and foster a secure environment for interaction. Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in removal from the group. 

Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to any one of us. 

Best regards, 

Aisha, Yvonne, Jeff & Ian

My child has an offer letter to Griffith Dublin.
What is the whole process, after paying tuition fees
Requirements:
‌I was told to pay tuition + medical Kando
‌Accommodation (how much could this be the cheapest), are there host families there?
(I was told regarding accommodation, can my child be hosted by school agents for 4 months without paying and then pay later) is this true? Can she get the cheapest rooms that can be cost shared to reduce expense?
‌Upkeep (how much can my child have at hand minimum to start off with) 
Can she get work and study? After how long? Which kind of work, can someone guide newbie? Who can?
Are there Kenyans around this school? Griffith? How fast can a newcomer adapt life huko?

Kindly guide me through
Concerned/ parent.
[07/12/2023, 22:27:04] ~ Wanja Kimingi: Hi Florence,  
To answer a few of your questions..
The cost of living is approximately 1,200 euros per month (including accommodation, food, books). This might differ from county to county.

Adapting to the new environment,  one has to be ready for the change, of course.. People here are nice and it is really good to have a circle of friends to keep yourself sane..

I might not be in a position to comment about work and study. Maybe someone else can advise..
But I know sometimes the studies can be so demanding and one is not able to work and raise enough upkeep and everything while still in school..

I have sent dozens of applications to different accommodation agencies eg Spotahome and I've gotten multiple rejections. For you guys who are already in Ireland, how can you help me/us with this? If I get visa approval I will be traveling to Dublin in January but getting accommodation is a serious issue. Your advice, support and leads will be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

The least you could say is "that's not possible" and advice him/her accordingly. I mean, that  was your potential client. 

You think that's  business? Not it's not! Such utterance would only come either from novice, ignorant or downright arrogant sales person.

Disappointed!

[22/12/2023, 05:52:44] ~ Dennis Muhika.: *Quoted from Irish Independent*

Neil Bruton, Campaigns Manager at the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, welcomed Minister Richmond’s announcement in relation to salary increases for employment permit holders.

He sought clarification on how the changes will affect thousands of people already on permits earning less than €30,000.

“In particular, we are delighted to see that salary levels for all employment permits will be increased to a level where they will be eligible for family reunion (€30,000),” he said.

“Nobody should be recruited to fill an important job in Ireland and be denied to right to have their family members with them.”

He said now, more than ever, Ireland needs to show we value the people that move here and the vital role they play in crucial sectors of our economy and these positive changes go some way to doing this.

He said MRCI has seen a big increase in the amount of cases of exploitation following increase in permits over the last two years.

“As more people come on permits to fill these shortages, we need to ensure they are adequately protected from exploitation.

To this end we need to give permit holders a simple and realistic way to change employer should they need to do so. 

This will enable people to stand up for their rights and challenge exploitative employers.”

[25/12/2023, 19:22:37] ~ Jimmmen RO: We need more platform to articulate our diversity
[25/12/2023, 19:27:36] ~ Jimmmen RO: Im not a slave to social media,if anything, and  anything, kenya is too corrupt and some people here are using corruption to educate themselves thro their parents
[25/12/2023, 19:28:52] ~ Sharon: You are a very dramatic person. I thought you got over the other day’s incident when you were very insensitive towards a member asking for help. 

Days later you have not got over it. So I will tell you for free, get over it. You made a mistake you were called out, people moved on, do the same

If you feel it’s necessary that you form a “ freedom” group then you forget what the purpose of this group is. 

You are talking about diversity in what context?Now that you  have a new group , why are you making noise and crying foul in another group?

I don’t know why admins have not taken this seriously but you would have been out of this group as soon as you responded to the person who asked for accommodation help and went on to be dramatic without offering an apology.

People like you are problematic and can actually cause problems in a group like you are doing. If you are uncomfortable, please leave. 

If f you must stay, follow the rules.

[03/01/2024, 17:23:39] ~ Sharon: Not to defend the behavior because it’s terrible and I am not a proclaimed feminist but this is definitely not the conclusion 

First, nothing about the video shows she is in power. She is not an MCA , nothing just affiliated to someone powerful. 

Two, she’s drunk. Alcohol impairs judgement. Probably when sober she would have handled the situation better 

Third. Basic education is literally high school and primary education. She speaks some good English, just chose the wrong words and tone😂 otherwise we can tell she’s learned.

That girl doesn’t seem drunk, from that video, she is well coordinated and articulated. Her brain needs a reset and taught a lesson. In Nigeria, she wouldn’t leave without arranging those papers back . They would matched her madness and she will calm down by force.

My statement was a response to another statement which trivialized the whole incident to a ‘slayqueen with power & no basic education’ 

I think she is drunk or high, may not be wobbly but those in the video also mentioned. It has to be intoxication that would get some to display such a character because.. 🤔

If anyone is working with students who are attending a different university, please tell them to contact their Access and Participation office or Student Services.
 
What is the 1916 Bursary?
The purpose of the 1916 Bursary is to encourage participation and success by students who are most socio-economically disadvantaged and who are from groups most under-represented in higher education. To be considered for a bursary, applicants must meet College Entry, Financial and Target Group eligibility criteria. Each college has a limited number of bursaries; they will be awarded to the eligible applicants that present the greatest need. 
 
What is the value of a 1916 Bursary?
There are three different types of bursaries – Tier 1, 2 and 3.
Tier 1: €5,000 per year for the normal duration of an undergraduate programme – or up to a maximum of six years for a part-time programme.
Tier 2: €2,000 per year for the normal duration of an undergraduate programme – or up to a maximum of six years for a part-time programme.
Tier 3: Awardees will receive a once-off bursary of €1,500 for the 2023/24 academic year only.

Today, Prime Cabinet Secretary Hon. Musalia Mudavadi inaugurated Nairobi’s NCLEX-RN Test Centre, alongside Cabinet Secretary for Health Nakhumicha S. Wafula and Principal Secretary of Public Health and Professional Standards Mary Muthoni Muriuki. This groundbreaking move signifies a departure from traditional practices, liberating Kenyan nurses from the necessity to undergo examinations in South Africa or India.

The fully-equipped NCLEX Centre is now operational, facilitating the administration of the National Council Licensure Examination – Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN), mandatory for nurses seeking licensure in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.

NCLEX - Exam Centre is finally in Nairobi, Kenya.👌

[26/01/2024, 11:08:11] ~ M@t3m0: Public participation for the new SHIF (Social Health Ins Fund) is open.  With the levy at 2.75% of earnings and without a cap the cost of this restricted cover could be more than international private medical cover!  Hence *opting out* should be allowed or a *cap* introduced.

Send email to *regulations@health.go.ke* and give your views and encourage others to do so too.  There is a slim chance you are heard but a bigger chance if many of us write to them.

You have till *9th Feb* only to do so
[26/01/2024, 15:06:40] ~ 🇰🇪🇬🇧🇮🇪: Some exciting news from the Migrants Rights Centre                 "After 14 years of campaigning, employment permit holders will soon have the right to change employer." 

 On Wednesday 31st January at 7 pm (estimated time) the Government will bring the Employment Permits Bill to Report stage in the Dáil. Please tune in yourself to see live the changes as they are announced next Wednesday evening 🇮🇪 ‎<This message was edited>

[28/01/2024, 10:25:46] ~ Emmanuel: Great start but still some still get away with it, I mean its Kenya. We should go back to Educating our young generation on going places with strangers like it used to be in the past.

[28/01/2024, 11:24:23] ~ ~NyagudiFredrickOpundo~: Hii story ni kama msumeno brathe, how many times have you heard men dying in airbns? It is always brushed off as another soldier has fallen in the line of duty, sometimes a red Herring (blue- pill gimmick) is thrown to dilute it further. Do you think that is always the case?

I am not pro femicide,  but the truth is, modern society set these two genders against each other. 

Life sentencing or Death sentencing can't be the solution.

Today being a lady in this group triggered me soo much.
I have lost/seen women I know die  or get hurt as a result of gender based violence.
Men in this group, if you can't help be an ambassador of #endfemicide.... Then just don't defend the act.... 
Am shocked by the remarks made in the group... Soo sad actually and worrying.
[28/01/2024, 22:27:47] ~ Marcel: R.I.P Tob Cohen the Dutch billionaire. That family might have forgiven but they will never forget the killers/ financiers. I don’t support femicide but I also urge women to be ambassadors and end killing men brutally🙏.
[28/01/2024, 22:35:27] ~ ~NyagudiFredrickOpundo~: How do you trust something on social media by an unverified account?
I said this and I'll repeat, this modern society set men and women against each other. The day we stopped the us against them is the day we'll start having a candid conversation. Kwa sasa hizi ni activism.

[08/02/2024, 21:23:13] ~ Daire Louise: As an Irish person having lived in Kenya for 3 years I see both sides of this story
[08/02/2024, 21:32:51] ~ ROBERT'OG: I think we need to help him 😅
[08/02/2024, 21:33:12] ~ Daire Louise: The post is last month
[08/02/2024, 21:33:59] ~ ROBERT'OG: Probably he's still stuck in Kenya. Any info?
[08/02/2024, 21:34:20] ~ Daire Louise: Rumour was he had social welfare from Ireland
[08/02/2024, 21:34:22] ~ Daire Louise: They cut it
[08/02/2024, 21:34:30] ~ Daire Louise: And the Kenyan girl used him
[08/02/2024, 21:35:04] ~ Daire Louise: Both are very believable
[08/02/2024, 21:35:14] ~ Daire Louise: Someone misusing social welfare
[08/02/2024, 21:35:27] ~ Daire Louise: Someone misusing rela9
[08/02/2024, 21:35:30] ~ Daire Louise: Relationship
[08/02/2024, 21:36:54] ~ ROBERT'OG: Are you sure? I think they used each other, both of them
[08/02/2024, 21:38:41] ~ Daire Louise: That's why there's 2 sentences there ?
[08/02/2024, 21:38:59] ~ Daire Louise: Or you read it as one ?
[08/02/2024, 21:39:15] ~ Davine Fernando: No rumour has it that he fled to Uganda
[08/02/2024, 21:39:25] ~ Daire Louise: Good for him
[08/02/2024, 21:39:30] ~ Davine Fernando: He was fundraising on tiktok some time back
[08/02/2024, 21:40:37] ~ Davine Fernando: Yes he used to send his social welfare to Kenya and told his girlfriend to keep it
[08/02/2024, 21:44:35] ~ Mel: Yes let's all help him by laughing at his stupidity
[08/02/2024, 21:44:39] ~ ROBERT'OG: Clarify please. To me it's simple. The guy wanted to have fun and got it. But sad that the story had a bad ending
[08/02/2024, 21:45:12] ~ Daire Louise: Or maybe he actually liked her ???
[08/02/2024, 21:45:16] ~ Daire Louise: And she used him ?
[08/02/2024, 21:45:22] ~ Daire Louise: It's not impossible
[08/02/2024, 21:46:16] ~ Daire Louise: I don't think anyone is out there claiming love and rejection if thy don't have too?

[08/02/2024, 21:54:56] ~ Daire Louise: He was clearly there for longer
[08/02/2024, 21:58:05] ~ Daire Louise: Or your thinking he found someone on Kiambu Road?
[08/02/2024, 21:58:25] ~ Daire Louise: 🤣
[08/02/2024, 21:58:36] ~ Daire Louise: There's clearly an element of truth on both sides
